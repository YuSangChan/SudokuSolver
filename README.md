# SudokuSolver
A toy Java program I wrote to solve Sudoku puzzles. It uses a brute force algorithm with backtracking. This is actually pretty effective for 9x9 puzzles, solving even the hardest ones in a second or two.

Reads in puzzles which I've been saving as white space delimited .txt files (see example_puzzle.txt, one of the puzzles I've been using for testing, for an example of what these look like) and writes the solution, if it exists, to standard output.

I don't expect anyone to be interested in this or (even view this repo!), but I'm including the MIT License just in case. If this code is for some reason interesting to you, have it.
